//! Utilities for atomic writes.
//!
//! For deployment of configuration files, we need to create a file atomically because certain
//! programs might watch configuration file for changes, so if it's not written atomically, then
//! file might be only partially written and a program trying to read it may crash.
//!
//! Atomic write of a file consists of creating a temporary file in the same directory, filling it
//! with correct content and permissions, and only then renaming the temporary into the destination
//! filename. Because we're never actually writing into the file, we don't need to write permissions
//! for the destination file, even if it exists. Instead we need only write/execute permissions to
//! the directory file is located in unless the directory has a sticky bit set. Overwriting a file
//! will also change its uid/gid/mode, if writing process euid/egid is different from file's
//! uid/gid. To keep uid/gid the same, after the write we need to do `chown`, and to do it we need
//! sudo.
